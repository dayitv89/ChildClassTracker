# ChildClassTracker
Parent class must know its child class and their object in Objective C. Suppose A super class inherited by child class B and B inherited by C, So A want to know that how much classes inherited and their object. In this case A must have object of B &amp; C without knowing the B &amp; C. It does mean we have to keep the object at memory creating of object.
